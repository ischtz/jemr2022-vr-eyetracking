# Eye Tracking in Virtual Reality: Vive Pro Eye Spatial Accuracy, Precision, and Calibration Reliability (JEMR, 2022)


This repository contains the experiment code, data, and analysis for our manuscript accepted in the *Journal of Eye Movement Research* (2022). 

## Experiment Code

The experiment was implemented in Python using WorldViz Vizard and [our *vexptoolbox* software toolbox](https://github.com/ischtz/vizard-experiment-toolbox) designed to aid in developing behavioral experiments on the Vizard platform. It can be run by opening *gaze_evaluation.py* within Vizard and pressing F5 or clicking the *Run* button. Currently, only the Vive Pro Eye built-in eye tracker is fully supported, but there is limited support for the Pupil Labs HTC Vive Add-On and the code can also be run without an eye tracker or VR headset connected. 

The experiment calibrates the chosen eye tracker, then presents 74 head-locked target positions across two distances (6 m and 0.5 m), spanning a range of +/- 15 degrees at 6 m and +/- 10 degrees at 0.5 m. After all targets have been displayed, a JSON file with raw gaze angle data and computed metrics is output (see below).


## Summary of Results

We found that participants (N=18) could be calibrated reliably, including those wearing contact lenses or glasses (*left figure*). On average, participants achieved a spatial accuracy of 1.1Â°, with higher accuracy (lower angular error) for more central compared to peripheral targets (*right figure*).

Please refer to the paper for detailed results, where we also statistically evaluate the effect of vision correction (contact lenses, glasses, or no correction) and estimate participants' inter-pupillary distance using the pupil positions detected by the eye tracker.
